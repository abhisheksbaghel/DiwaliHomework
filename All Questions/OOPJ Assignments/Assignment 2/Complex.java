/*
Question 3

Write a class to represent complex numbers with necessary constructors. 
Write member functions to add, multiply 
two complex numbers. There should be three constructors: 
(i) to initialize real and imaginary parts to 0; 
(ii) to initialize imaginary part to 0 but to initialize the real part to user defined value; 
(iii) to initialize the real part and the imaginary part to user defined values. 
Also, write a main() function to 
(i) create two complex numbers 3+2i and 4-2i; 
(ii) to print the sum and product of those numbers
