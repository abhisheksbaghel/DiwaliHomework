//You are given a list of strings, times, where each string represent a timestamp of a twenty-four hour clock (i.e. hours and minutes - “HH:MM”). Return the minimum difference, in minutes, between any two of the timestamps in the list.
Ex: Given the following times…
times = ["01:00", "01:10"], return 10 (i.e. there are 10 minutes between the two times).
Ex: Given the following times…
times = ["00:00", "12:23", "05:50", "23:12"], return 48.
